# Outline/overview
1\. Theoretical Foundations and Context
---------------------------------------

-   **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH):** Look into literature on EMH to understand how news dissemination theoretically affects stock prices. According to EMH, any publicly available information (like news articles) should be immediately reflected in stock prices.
-   **Behavioral Finance:** Since EMH may not always hold true, behavioral finance examines the emotional and psychological influences on investors that can create inefficiencies. This is relevant to understanding how investor reactions to news can drive stock prices in ways that might be predictable.

2\. Impact of News on Stock Prices and Markets
----------------------------------------------

-   **News Sentiment Analysis:** Study papers that analyze the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices. Many studies use sentiment analysis to determine how positive or negative news can influence stock performance, often measuring the sentiment from news articles, press releases, or social media.
-   **Event Study Methodology:** This approach is commonly used in finance to assess how a specific news event (like a political decision, corporate announcement, or economic news) impacts stock prices around the event date. Event studies can provide a structure for analyzing the immediate effect of certain types of news on the Maltese stock exchange.

3\. Machine Learning and Stock Prediction
-----------------------------------------

-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Financial Markets:** NLP is often applied to process and interpret the language used in financial news, which can then be correlated with stock performance. Look for research using NLP to analyze the tone, emotion, and subject matter of news as predictors for stock trends.
-   **Prediction Models Using News Data:** Studies applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) for stock prediction based on news sentiment are relevant here. Some research explores using these techniques in smaller or less liquid markets, which may be useful given Malta's smaller market size.

4\. Region-Specific Studies
---------------------------

-   **Malta's Financial Market Characteristics:** The Maltese stock exchange is smaller, so look into sources that describe how news affects smaller or less liquid markets specifically, as these often react differently than larger exchanges.
-   **Cultural and Political Influences on Financial Markets in Malta:** Understanding local news context and investor behavior may help you identify unique factors affecting Maltese stocks. This could include Maltese economic policies, the role of EU regulations, or local business news influencing investor confidence and behavior.

5\. Sentiment Analysis Techniques and Tools
-------------------------------------------

-   **Sentiment Analysis Tools and Models:** Look at literature discussing various sentiment analysis tools and techniques---like the lexicon-based approach, machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes), and neural networks. Some studies compare these methods for accuracy in sentiment detection, especially in financial contexts.
-   **Training and Validation of Sentiment Models:** For prediction accuracy, the quality and specificity of sentiment analysis on news are crucial. Papers that discuss model training, accuracy metrics (such as precision, recall, and F1-score), and validation methods (cross-validation, A/B testing) could provide insight for building or choosing a model that suits your needs.

6\. Limitations and Ethical Considerations
------------------------------------------

-   **Limitations of Predictive Models:** Explore literature on the limitations of using news sentiment in stock predictions, including issues with data quality, news lag, model overfitting, and the potential for self-fulfilling prophecies.
-   **Ethics in Automated Stock Prediction:** Automation in finance, including algorithmic trading, can have ethical and regulatory implications, particularly in smaller markets where news might disproportionately affect stock prices.

Types of Sources to Look For
----------------------------

1.  **Academic Journals:** Look for studies in journals specializing in finance, econometrics, machine learning, and NLP. Journals like the *Journal of Financial Economics*, *European Financial Management*, and *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering* may be useful.

2.  **Financial Market Reports and Case Studies on Malta:** Malta-specific case studies, regulatory filings, and financial market reports can provide insight into the structure and unique characteristics of the Maltese stock exchange.

3.  **NLP and Machine Learning Papers:** Research papers on NLP applications in finance and stock prediction, typically found in conferences such as ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning).

4.  **Government and Regulatory Publications:** Maltese regulatory bodies, such as the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), may publish reports on stock exchange trends, investor behavior, or case studies that offer context on the country's financial market structure and dynamics.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

-   **Data Sources for Maltese News and Stock Prices:** Since Malta is a smaller market, ensure you have reliable and accessible data sources for both news articles and historical stock prices.
-   **Temporal Alignment in Data Collection:** Collecting time-stamped news data and matching it with stock price fluctuations requires precise alignment. Ensure that the news data you use has timestamps that allow for effective event-study design or real-time analysis.
-   **Interdisciplinary Insights:** Combining finance, psychology (for investor sentiment), and machine learning perspectives will give a broader understanding of how news can influence stock prices and predictive accuracy.
